# PRINTS HEADERS

### Use it with 007

This util for the [007 programming language](https://github.com/masak/007) prints headers using a ASCII-art font.

**Usage:** print_header(["H","E","L","L","O"," ","W","O","R","L","D"]);

*Since 007 currently don't allow sequencing of strings, you need to
use the array format. Considering that headers are not common I think
it's OK!*
